Microsoft is announcing that Wiki (see below screenshots) will be retired from Teams. We are offering note taking capabilities through Teams Channels powered by OneNote. The  change will be rolled out starting mid-February of this year. With this release, users have an option to export their wiki content to OneNote notebooks in Teams standard channel. After exporting users can go to the Notes tab to collaborate using OneNote in channels. Note: With this change users can continue to access and edit existing wikis but canâ€™t create new wikis in Teams channels.

You can use the script "ShowAllLegacyWikiSites.ps1" to list down all sharepoint sites that have the legacy wiki. (that script requires pnp powershell to be installed: https://github.com/Chunlong101/SharePointScripts#sharepointscripts)
